## Minigrep
---
This mini project is part of my [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language learning. We tried here to make our own version of
the command line search tool `grep` that stands for **g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint. In the simple use case,
grep searches a specified file for a specified string. Then it reads the file, fids lines in that file that contain the string argument,
and prints those lines.

## License and Credits
All the credits goes to Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols and the rust community for writing the book
[The rust Progamming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html). Most of the code comes from this book as it is my
learning material.
